#summary KeychainAES256KeyKeeper documentation.

=== Intent ===

To provide with a single location to get AES256 random key.

The key is generated randomly first and then stored into the Keychain.

=== Files involved ===

All under:
[http://code.google.com/p/ziptk/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/Security Security]

 * !KeychainAES256KeyKeeper.h
 * !KeychainAES256KeyKeeper.m

=== Internal behavior ===

If no key is stored on the AES256 the class generates a new one and stores it, else it returns the stored AES256 key.

=== Usage sample code ===

Just call the Class method:
{{{
NSString *key =
[KeychainAES256KeyKeeper getAES256Key];
}}}
